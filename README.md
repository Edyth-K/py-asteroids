## What does it do?
py-asteroids is a simple Asteroids clone made using pygame. Players control a triangular spaceship that can rotate, move, and shoot bullets to destroy asteroids that spawn randomly around the screen. The game ends when the player collides with an asteroid.

## Technologies/Libraries Used
- **Python** - Core programming language
- **pygame 2.6.1** - Game development library for graphics, input handling, and game loop management

## Main Features Implemented
- Player spaceship with rotation and movement controls
- Bullet shooting system with cooldown mechanics
- Asteroid spawning and field management
- Collision detection between player/asteroids and bullets/asteroids
- Asteroid splitting mechanics when hit by bullets
- Real-time game rendering at 60 FPS

## Possible Extensions to the Project:
- Add a scoring system
- Implement multiple lives and respawning
- Add an explosion effect for the asteroids
- Add acceleration to the player movement
- Make the objects wrap around the screen instead of disappearing
- Add a background image
- Create different weapon types
- Make the asteroids lumpy instead of perfectly round
- Make the ship have a triangular hit box instead of a circular one
- Add a shield power-up
- Add a speed power-up
- Add bombs that can be dropped
